				Framework: Vue.js
					Vue.js: An open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework that we utilized to create
					and dynamically modify our webpage. For example, this framework allowed us to dynamically populate
					our table based on our maps current bounds.
					URL:https://vuejs.org/
					
				API(s): Nominatim, RESTful (local Server), Leaflet
					Nominatim: A search engine for OpenStreetMap data. This allowed us to construct our
						search engine and move our map to specified latitude and longitude coordinates, or
						specified address
						URL:http://nominatim.org/
					
					RESTful (local Server): Allowed us to utilize search query's in our database and obtain
						a list of objects that corresponds to a specified search result. 
					
					Leaflet: A 'map' object constructor that allowed us to create our map in addition to 
						populating it with markers, updating our table only with locations within the map bounds,
						and panning it to specified locations via the Nominatim API.
						URL:https://leafletjs.com/
