		<h2>Description of tools used to create this application</h2>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					Node.js: Run time environment. Used Express package to create RESTful server and test server functionality.
					Other packages in Node.js used include: xml parser, cors, sqlite3 database connection, etc.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					Framework: Vue.js
						Vue.js: An open-source Model–view–viewmodel JavaScript framework that we utilized to create
						and dynamically modify our webpage. For example, this framework allowed us to dynamically populate
						our table with St. Paul crime incidents dependending on wether or not the neighborhood that incident 
						occurred in was visible on the map.
						URL:https://vuejs.org/
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					API(s): Nominatim, RESTful (local Server), Leaflet
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					Nominatim: A search engine for OpenStreetMap data. This allowed us to construct our
					search engine and move our map to specified latitude and longitude coordinates, or
					specified address
					URL:http://nominatim.org/	
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					RESTful (local Server): Allowed us to utilize search query's in our database and obtain
					a list of objects that corresponds to a specified search result. 
				</td>
			</tr>
				<td>
					Leaflet: A 'map' object constructor that allowed us to create our map in addition to 
						populating it with markers, updating our table only with locations within the map bounds,
						and panning it to specified locations via the Nominatim API.
						URL:https://leafletjs.com/
